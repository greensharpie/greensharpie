# About Me:
Hello, my name is Kevin Blanco and I'm a Software Engineer with a background in healthcare. After gaining experience in program management, I transitioned into software engineering where I‚Äôve been able to apply my problem-solving skills and critical thinking from healthcare to software development. <br>I enjoy working collaboratively with teams to tackle complex challenges and am committed to continuously learning and refining my skills. My background in healthcare has provided me with a unique perspective, which I bring to my work as an engineer. I look forward to growing further and contributing to meaningful projects in the future.
